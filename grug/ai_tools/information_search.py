# TODO: copy over code for general searches, thinking of re-writing it to be a second graph that knows which TTRPG
#       the play is using and use tools (like AoN for pathfinder) that are specific to that TTRPG.
# TODO: this is also where the RAG stuff comes in where admins can upload source material and have it be searchable.
