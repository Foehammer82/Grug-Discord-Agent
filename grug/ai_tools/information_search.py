# TODO: copy over code for general searches, thinking of re-writing it to be a second graph that knows which TTRPG
#       the play is using and use tools (like AoN for pathfinder) that are specific to that TTRPG.
# TODO: this is also where the RAG stuff comes in where admins can upload source material and have it be searchable.
# TODO: create a slash-command that the user can use to set which TTTRPG they are playing and use that here when
#       looking up information.  it would also be good to send a warning or something if no source material is found
#       and give instructions for how to upload it.  should also have slash commands to perform crud operations on the
#       source material for their server/guild.
