# TODO: re-write the code for listening to a discord voice channel with tools to search what was said and get summaries
# TODO: actually store the summaries in the database and make tooling to output them to google docs or other formats,
#       along with having them go to a dedicate text channel for session notes.
# TODO: users should be able to tell grug to start and stop recording, and to get the notes from the session.
