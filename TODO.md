# TODO

- [ ] add docs for self hosting
- [ ] add docs for general usage and features of Grug
- [ ] rules lookup
    - users must upload their own rulebooks and content as that is typically closed source
    - some tools will be provided out of the box, such as AoN for Pathfinder, and
    - online resources that are open for use:
        - https://media.wizards.com/2018/dnd/downloads/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf
        - AoN for Pathfinder
- [ ] session notes (by listening to the play session)
- [ ] scheduling and reminders
    - [ ] ability to send reminder for the upcoming session
    - [ ] food tracking feature (for in-person sessions where there is a rotation of who brings food)
    - [ ] ability to send reminder for who is bringing food
    - [ ] scheduling feature for when the next session will be, and who is available (find a time that works best for
      everyone)
